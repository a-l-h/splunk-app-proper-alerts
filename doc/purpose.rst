Maintaining properly configured alerts is not an easy task.

Is the search properly structured? Is data source still being indexed? Are search time and schedule coordinated? What if the runtime is longer than the interval between two occurrences of the same alert?

You probably answered these questions while reviewing alerts from time to time but it can quickly become a painful task if the number of alerts rises and it is not rare to see an environment in which Splunk admins lost track of running alerts with consequences such as alerts being missed and improper resources usage.

The goal of this App is to help maintaining properly configured alerts.

It does so by providing an interactive dashboard that lets Splunk admins review each alert effortlessly and by notifying them whenever a new or modified alert has to be reviewed.
